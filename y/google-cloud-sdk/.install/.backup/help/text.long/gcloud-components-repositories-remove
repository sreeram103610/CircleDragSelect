DESCRIPTION
       Remove a registered Trusted Tester component repository from the list
       of repositories used by the component manager. After removing a
       repository, you can run: $ gcloud components update to revert back to
       the standard version of any components that were installed from that
       repository.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [URL ...]
           Zero or more URLs for the component repositories you want to
           remove. If none are given, you will be prompted to choose which
           existing repository you want to remove.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       Add a new Trusted Tester component repository to the list of
       repositories used by the component manager. This will allow you to
       install and update components found in this repository.

       If you are participating in a Trusted Tester program, you will be
       instructed on the location of repositories with additional versions of
       one or more Cloud SDK components.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       URL [URL ...]
           One or more URLs for the component repositories you want to add.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       $ gcloud components repositories add http://repo.location.com

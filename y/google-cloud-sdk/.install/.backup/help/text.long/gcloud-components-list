       gcloud-components-list - List all packages and individual components in
       the Cloud SDK and provide information such as whether the component is

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud components list
         [--format FORMAT]
         [--help]

DESCRIPTION
       This command lists all the tools in the Cloud SDK (both individual
       components and preconfigured packages of components). For each
       component, the command lists the following information: * Status on
       your local workstation: not installed, installed (and up to date), and
       update available (installed, but not up to date) * Name of the
       component (a description) * ID of the component (used to refer to the
       component in other [gcloud components] commands) * Size of the
       component In addition, if the --show-versions flag is specified, the
       command lists the currently installed version (if any) and the latest
       available version of each individual component.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --show-versions
           Show installed and available versions of all components.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgcloud compute forwarding\-rules create\fR is used to create a forwarding rule\&. Forwarding rules match and direct certain types of traffic to a load balancer which is controlled by a target pool, a target instance, or a target HTTP proxy\&. Target pools and target instances perform load balancing at the layer 3 of the OSI networking model (http://en\&.wikipedia\&.org/wiki/Network_layer)\&. Target HTTP proxies perform load balancing at layer 7\&.
.sp
Forwarding rules can be either regional or global\&. They are regional if they point to a target pool or a target instance and global if they point to a target HTTP proxy\&.
.sp
For more information on load balancing, see https://developers\&.google\&.com/compute/docs/load\-balancing/\&.
.sp
When creating a forwarding rule, exactly one of \(lq\-\-target\-instance\(rq \(lq\-\-target\-pool\(rq, and \(lq\-\-target\-http\-proxy\(rq must be specified\&.
.SH "POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fINAME\fR
.RS 4
The name of the forwarding rule\&.
.RE
.SH "FLAGS"
.PP
\fB\-\-address\fR \fIADDRESS\fR
.RS 4
The external IP address that the forwarding rule will serve\&. All traffic sent to this IP address is directed to the target pointed to by the forwarding rule\&. If the address is reserved, it must either (1) reside in the global scope if the forwarding rule is being configured to point to a target HTTP proxy or (2) reside in the same region as the forwarding rule if the forwarding rule is being configured to point to a target pool or target instance\&. If this flag is omitted, an ephemeral IP address is assigned\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-description\fR \fIDESCRIPTION\fR
.RS 4
An optional textual description for the forwarding rule\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-format\fR \fIFORMAT\fR
.RS 4
Specify a format for printed output\&. By default, a command\-specific human\-friendly output format is used\&. Setting this flag to one of the available options will serialize the result of the command in the chosen format and print it to stdout\&. Supported formats are: "json", "text", "yaml"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-global\fR
.RS 4
If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global\&. A forwarding rule is global if it references a target HTTP proxy\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Display detailed help\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ip\-protocol\fR \fIIP_PROTOCOL\fR
.RS 4
The IP protocol that the rule will serve\&. If left empty, TCP is used\&. Supported protocols are: AH, ESP, SCTP, TCP, UDP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\-range\fR \fI[PORT | PORT\-PORT]\fR
.RS 4
If specified, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded\&. If not specified for regional forwarding rules, all ports are matched\&. This flag is required for global forwarding rules\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-project\fR \fIPROJECT\fR
.RS 4
Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands\&. If input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be raised\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-region\fR \fIREGION\fR
.RS 4
The region of the forwarding rule to operate on\&. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a region\&.
.sp
To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the \(lqcompute/region\(rq property:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud config set compute/region REGION
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of regions can fetched by running:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud compute regions list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To unset the property, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud config unset compute/region
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable \(lqCLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-http\-proxy\fR \fITARGET_HTTP_PROXY\fR
.RS 4
The target HTTP proxy that will receive the traffic\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-instance\fR \fITARGET_INSTANCE\fR
.RS 4
The name of the target instance that will receive the traffic\&. The target instance must be in a zone that\(cqs in the forwarding rule\(cqs region\&. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target instances\&. If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone\&.
.sp
To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the \(lqcompute/zone\(rq property:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of zones can fetched by running:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud compute zones list
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
To unset the property, run:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
gcloud config unset compute/zone
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable \(lqCLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-instance\-zone\fR \fITARGET_INSTANCE_ZONE\fR
.RS 4
The zone of the target instance\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-target\-pool\fR \fITARGET_POOL\fR
.RS 4
The target pool that will receive the traffic\&. The target pool must be in the same region as the forwarding rule\&. Global forwarding rules may not direct traffic to target pools\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Download the lastest version of each listed item, and the latest version of all components upon which the listed items directly or indirectly depend, if that version is not already installed on the local workstation\&. The items may be individual components or preconfigured packages\&. If a downloaded component was not previously installed, the downloaded version is installed\&. If an earlier version of the component was previously installed, that version is replaced by the downloaded version\&.
.sp
If, for example, the component unicorn\-factory depends on the component horn\-factory, installing the latest version of unicorn\-factory will cause the version of horn\-factory upon which it depends to be installed as well, if it is not already installed\&. The command lists all components it is about to install, and asks for confirmation before proceeding\&.

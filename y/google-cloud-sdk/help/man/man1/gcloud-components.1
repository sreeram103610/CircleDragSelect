.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
List, install, update, or remove Google Cloud SDK tools\&.
.sp
Because you might need only some of the tools in the Cloud SDK to do your work, you can control which tools are installed on your workstation\&. You can install new tools on your workstation when you find that you need them, and remove tools that you no longer need\&. The gcloud command regularly checks whether updates are available for the tools you already have installed, and gives you the opportunity to upgrade to the latest version\&.
.sp
Tools can be installed as individual components or as preconfigured \fIpackages\fR of components that are typically all used together to perform a particular task (such as developing a PHP application on App Engine)\&.
.sp
Certain components \fIdepend\fR on other components\&. When you install a component that you need, all components upon which it directly or indirectly depends, and that are not already present on your workstation, are installed automatically\&. When you remove a component, all components that depend on the removed component are also removed\&.

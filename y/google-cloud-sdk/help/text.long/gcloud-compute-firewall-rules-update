DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute firewall-rules update is used to update firewall rules
       that allow incoming traffic to a network. Only arguments passed in will
       be updated on the firewall rule. Other attributes will remain
       unaffected.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the firewall rule to update.

FLAGS
       --allow [PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]] ...]
           A list of protocols and ports whose traffic will be allowed.
           Setting this will override the current values.

           PROTOCOL is the IP protocol whose traffic will be allowed.
           PROTOCOL can be either the name of a well-known protocol (e.g.,
           "tcp" or "icmp") or the IP protocol number. A list of IP protocols
           can be found at
           http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml.

           A port or port range can be specified after PROTOCOL to allow
           traffic through specific ports. If no port or port range is
           specified, connections through all ranges are allowed. For example,
           the following will create a rule that allows TCP traffic through
           port 80 and allows ICMP traffic:

               $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update my-rule --allow tcp:80 icmp

           TCP and UDP rules must include a port or port range.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           A textual description for the firewall rule. Set to an empty string
           to clear existing description.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --source-ranges [CIDR_RANGE ...]
           A list of IP address blocks that are allowed to make inbound
           connections that match the firewall rule to the instances on the
           network. The IP address blocks must be specified in CIDR format:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing.
           Setting this will override the existing source ranges for the
           firewall. The following will clear the existing source ranges:

               $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update my-rule --source-ranges

       --source-tags [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may accept inbound connections that match the
           firewall rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can receive
           inbound connections that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
           this will override the existing source tags for the firewall. The
           following will clear the existing source tags:

               $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update my-rule --source-tags

       --target-tags [TAG ...]
           A list of instance tags indicating the set of instances on the
           network which may make network connections that match the firewall
           rule. If omitted, all instances on the network can make connections
           that match the rule.

           Tags can be assigned to instances during instance creation. Setting
           this will override the existing target tags for the firewall. The
           following will clear the existing target tags:

               $ gcloud compute firewall-rules update my-rule --target-tags

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

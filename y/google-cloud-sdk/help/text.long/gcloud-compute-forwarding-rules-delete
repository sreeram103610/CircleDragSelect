DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute forwarding-rules delete deletes one or more Google
       Compute Engine forwarding rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The names of the forwarding rules to delete.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --global
           If provided, assume the forwarding rules are global. A forwarding
           rule is global if it references a target HTTP proxy.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --region REGION
           The region of the forwarding rule to operate on. If not specified,
           you will be prompted to select a region.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/region" property:

               gcloud config set compute/region REGION

           A list of regions can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute regions list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/region

           Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

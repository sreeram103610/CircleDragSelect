DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute url-maps remove-host-rule is used to remove a host rule
       from a URL map. When a host rule is removed, its path matcher is only
       removed if it is not referenced by any other host rules and
       "--delete-orphaned-path-matcher" is provided.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the URL map.

FLAGS
       --delete-orphaned-path-matcher
           If provided and a path matcher is orphaned as a result of this
           command, the command removes the orphaned path matcher instead of
           failing.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --host HOST
           One of the hosts in the host rule to remove.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To remove a host rule that contains the host "google.com" from the URL
       map named "my-url-map", you can use this command:

           $ gcloud compute url-maps remove-host-rule my-url-map \
               --host google.com

       gcloud compute instances attach-disk

         --disk DISK
         [--format FORMAT]

         [--zone ZONE]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances attach-disk is used to attach a disk to an
       instance. For example,

           $ compute instances attach-disk my-instance --disk my-disk
             --zone us-central1-a

       attaches the disk named "my-disk" to the instance named "my-instance"
       in zone "us-central1-a".

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       INSTANCE
           The name of the instance to attach the disk to.

FLAGS
       --device-name DEVICE_NAME
           An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest operating
           system will see.

       --disk DISK
           The name of the disk to attach to the instance.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --mode MODE
           Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are "ro" for
           read-only and "rw" for read-write. If omitted, "rw" is used as a
           default. It is an error to attach a disk in read-write mode to more
           than one instance.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instance to attach a disk to. If not specified, you
           will be prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

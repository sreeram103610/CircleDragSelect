DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances delete deletes one or more Google Compute
       Engine virtual machine instances.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The instances to delete.

FLAGS
       --delete-disks {boot,data,all}
           The types of disks to delete with instance deletion regardless of
           the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is provided,
           the auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified accordingly
           before the instance deletion requests are issued. For more
           information on disk auto-deletion, see
           https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --keep-disks {boot,data,all}
           The types of disks to not delete with instance deletion regardless
           of the disks' auto-delete configuration. When this flag is
           provided, the auto-delete bits on the attached disks are modified
           accordingly before the instance deletion requests are issued. For
           more information on disk auto-deletion, see
           https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/disks#updateautodelete.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instances to delete. If not specified, you will be
           prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

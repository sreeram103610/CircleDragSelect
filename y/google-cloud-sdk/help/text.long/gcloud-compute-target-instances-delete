DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-instances delete deletes one or more Google
       Compute Engine target instances. Target instances can be deleted only
       if they are not being used by any other resources like forwarding
       rules.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The resources to delete.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the resources to delete. If not specified, you will be
           prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

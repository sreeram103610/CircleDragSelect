       pool

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute target-pools set-backup
         NAME
         --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]
         [--failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO]
         [--format FORMAT]
         [--help]

         [--quiet, -q]
         [--region REGION]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-pools set-backup is used to set a backup target
       pool for a primary target pool, which defines the fallback behavior of
       the primary pool. If the ratio of the healthy instances in the primary
       pool is at or below the specified "--failover-ratio value", then
       traffic arriving at the load-balanced IP address will be directed to
       the backup pool.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target pool for which to set the backup pool.

FLAGS
       --backup-pool [BACKUP_POOL]
           Name of the target pool that will serve as backup. If this flag is
           provided without a value, the existing backup pool is removed.

       --failover-ratio FAILOVER_RATIO
           The new failover ratio value for the target pool. This must be a
           float in the range of [0, 1].

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --region REGION
           The region of the target pool to set a backup pool for. If not
           specified, you will be prompted to select a region.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/region" property:

               gcloud config set compute/region REGION

           A list of regions can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute regions list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/region

           Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To cause "my-target-pool" (in region "us-central1") to fail over to
       "my-backup-pool" when more than half of my-target-pool's instances are
       unhealthy, run:

           $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup my-target-pool \
               --backup-pool my-backup-pool --failover-ratio 0.5 \
               --region us-central1

       To remove "my-backup-pool" as a backup to "my-target-pool", run:

           $ gcloud compute target-pools set-backup my-target-pool \
               --backup-pool \
               --region us-central1

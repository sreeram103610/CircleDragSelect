DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute networks delete deletes one or more Google Compute
       Engine networks. Networks can only be deleted when no other resources
       (e.g., virtual machine instances) refer to them.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The resources to delete.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

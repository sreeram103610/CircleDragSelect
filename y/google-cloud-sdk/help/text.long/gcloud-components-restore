NAME
       gcloud-components-restore - This is an undo operation, which restores
       the Cloud SDK installation on the local workstation to the state it was
       in just before the most recent `[gcloud components] update` or `[gcloud
       components] remove` command. Only the state before the most recent such
       state is remembered, so it is impossible to restore the state that
       existed before the two most recent `update` commands, for example. A
       `restore` command does not undo a previous `restore` command.

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud components restore
         [--format FORMAT]
         [--help]
         [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q]
         [-h]

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

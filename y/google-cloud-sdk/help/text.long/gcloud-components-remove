NAME
       gcloud-components-remove - Uninstall all listed components, as well as
       all components that directly or indirectly depend on them.

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud components remove
         COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...]
         [--format FORMAT]
         [--help]
         [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       Uninstall all listed components, as well as all components that
       directly or indirectly depend on them. For example, if the component
       unicorn-factory depends on the component horn-factory, removing
       horn-factory will cause unicorn-factory to be removed as well. The
       command lists all components it is about to remove, and asks for
       confirmation before proceeding.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       COMPONENT-ID [COMPONENT-ID ...]
           The IDs of the components to be removed.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To remove component-1, component-2, and all components that directly or
       indirectly depend on component-1 or component-2, type the following:

           $ gcloud components remove component-1 component-2

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute url-maps edit can be used to modify a URL map. The URL
       map resource is fetched from the server and presented in a text editor.
       After the file is saved and closed, this command will update the
       resource. Only fields that can be modified are displayed in the editor.

       The editor used to modify the resource is chosen by inspecting the
       "EDITOR" environment variable.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the URL map to modify.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

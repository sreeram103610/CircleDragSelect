DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute networks create is used to create virtual networks. A
       network performs the same function that a router does in a home
       network: it describes the network range and gateway IP address, handles
       communication between instances, and serves as a gateway between
       instances and callers outside the network.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the network.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the network.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --range RANGE
           Specifies the IPv4 address range of this network. The range must be
           specified in CIDR format:
           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing. If
           omitted, 10.240.0.0/16 is used.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

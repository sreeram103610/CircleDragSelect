       gcloud-auth-login - Obtains access credentials for the Google Cloud
       Platform resources of the given account, via a web flow. If the account

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [ACCOUNT]
           The account to log in as.

FLAGS
       --do-not-activate
           Do not set the new credentials as active.

       --force
           Re-run the web flow even if the given account has valid
           credentials.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --no-launch-browser
           Print a URL to be copied instead of launching a web browser.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

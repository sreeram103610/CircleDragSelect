DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute instances create facilitates the creation of Google
       Compute Engine virtual machines. For example, running:

           $ gcloud compute instances create \
               my-instance-1 my-instance-2 my-instance-3 \
               --zone us-central1-a

       will create three instances called "my-instance-1", "my-instance-2",
       and "my-instance-3" in the "us-central1-a" zone.

       For more examples, refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME [NAME ...]
           The names of the instances to create.

FLAGS
       --address ADDRESS
           Assigns the given external IP address to the instance that is
           created. This option can only be used when creating a single
           instance.

       --boot-disk-device-name BOOT_DISK_DEVICE_NAME
           The name the guest operating system will see for the boot disk as.
           This option can only be specified if a new boot disk is being
           created (as opposed to mounting an existing persistent disk).

       --boot-disk-size BOOT_DISK_SIZE
           The size of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a
           new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
           persistent disk). The value must be a whole number followed by a
           size unit of "KB" for kilobyte, "MB" for megabyte, "GB" for
           gigabyte, or "TB" for terabyte. For example, "10GB" will produce a
           10 gigabyte disk. If omitted, a default size of 200 GB is used. The
           minimum size a boot disk can have is 10 GB. Disk size must be a
           multiple of 1 GB.

       --boot-disk-type BOOT_DISK_TYPE
           The type of the boot disk. This option can only be specified if a
           new boot disk is being created (as opposed to mounting an existing
           persistent disk). To get a list of available disk types, run gcloud
           compute disk-types list.

       --can-ip-forward
           If provided, allows the instances to send and receive packets with
           non-matching destination or source IP addresses.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           Specifies a textual description of the instances.

       --disk PROPERTY=VALUE [PROPERTY=VALUE ...]
           Attaches persistent disks to the instances. The disks specified
           must already exist.

           name
               The disk to attach to the instances. When creating more than
               one instance and using this property, the only valid mode for
               attaching the disk is read-only (see mode below).

           mode
               Specifies the mode of the disk. Supported options are "ro" for
               read-only and "rw" for read-write. If omitted, "rw" is used as
               a default. It is an error for mode to be "rw" when creating
               more than one instance because read-write disks can only be
               attached to a single instance.

           boot
               If "yes", indicates that this is a boot disk. The virtual
               machines will use the first partition of the disk for their
               root file systems. The default value for this is "no".

           device-name
               An optional name that indicates the disk name the guest
               operating system will see. If omitted, a device name of the
               form "persistent-disk-N" will be used.

           auto-delete
               If "yes", this persistent disk will be automatically deleted
               when the instance is deleted. However, if the disk is later
               detached from the instance, this option won't apply. The
               default value for this is "no".

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --image IMAGE | centos-6 | centos-7 | coreos | debian-7 |
       debian-7-backports | opensuse-13 | rhel-6 | rhel-7 | sles-11
           Specifies the boot image for the instances. For each instance, a
           new boot disk will be created from the given image. Each boot disk
           will have the same name as the instance.

           The value for this option can be the name of an image or an alias
           from the table below.

           Alias                Project          Image Name
           centos-6             centos-cloud     centos-6
           centos-7             centos-cloud     centos-7
           coreos               coreos-cloud     coreos-stable
           debian-7             debian-cloud     debian-7-wheezy
           debian-7-backports   debian-cloud     backports-debian-7-wheezy
           opensuse-13          opensuse-cloud   opensuse-13
           rhel-6               rhel-cloud       rhel-6
           rhel-7               rhel-cloud       rhel-7
           sles-11              suse-cloud       sles-11

           When the value is an alias, this tool will query the public image
           project that contains the image type to find the latest image
           matching the alias. The user's project is also queried for an image
           with the same name as the alias. If a conflict exists, the user
           will be prompted to resolve the conflict.

           To specify an image in another project for which there is no alias,
           use "--image-project". When "--image-project" is present, no API
           calls are made to resolve the image. This property is useful for
           scripts.

           When using this option, "--boot-disk-device-name" and
           "--boot-disk-size" can be used to override the boot disk's device
           name and size, respectively.

           By default, "debian-7-backports" is assumed for this flag.

       --image-project IMAGE_PROJECT
           The project against which all image references will be resolved.
           See "--image" for more details.

       --machine-type MACHINE_TYPE
           Specifies the machine type used for the instances. To get a list of
           available machine types, run gcloud compute machine-types list.

       --maintenance-policy MAINTENANCE_POLICY
           Specifies the behavior of the instances when their host machines
           undergo maintenance. "TERMINATE" indicates that the instances
           should be terminated. "MIGRATE" indicates that the instances should
           be migrated to a new host. Choosing "MIGRATE" will temporarily
           impact the performance of instances during a migration event. If
           omitted, "MIGRATE" is assumed.

       --metadata KEY=VALUE [KEY=VALUE ...]
           Metadata to be made available to the guest operating system running
           on the instances. Each metadata entry is a key/value pair separated
           by an equals sign. Metadata keys must be unique and less than 128
           bytes in length. Values must be less than or equal to 32,768 bytes
           in length. Multiple arguments can be passed to this flag, e.g.,
           "--metadata key-1=value-1 key-2=value-2 key-3=value-3".

           In images that have Compute Engine tools installed on them, the
           following metadata keys have special meanings:

           startup-script
               Specifies a script that will be executed by the instances once
               they start running. For convenience, "--metadata-from-file" can
               be used to pull the value from a file.

           startup-script-url
               Same as "startup-script" except that the script contents are
               pulled from a publicly-accessible location on the web.

       --metadata-from-file KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH [KEY=LOCAL_FILE_PATH ...]
           Same as "--metadata" except that the value for the entry will be
           read from a local file. This is useful for values that are too
           large such as "startup-script" contents.

       --network NETWORK
           Specifies the network that the instances will be part of. If
           omitted, the "default" network is used.

       --no-address
           If provided, the instances will not be assigned external IP
           addresses.

       --no-boot-disk-auto-delete
           If provided, boot disks will not be automatically deleted when
           their instances are deleted.

       --no-restart-on-failure
           If provided, the instances will not be restarted if they are
           terminated by Compute Engine. By default, failed instances will be
           restarted. This does not affect terminations performed by the user.

       --no-scopes
           If provided, the default scopes
           (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only) are not
           added to the instances.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --scopes [ACCOUNT=]SCOPE [[ACCOUNT=]SCOPE ...]
           Specifies service accounts and scopes for the instances. Service
           accounts generate access tokens that can be accessed through the
           instance metadata server and used to authenticate applications on
           the instance. The account can be either an email address or an
           alias corresponding to a service account. If account is omitted,
           the project's default service account is used. The default service
           account can be specified explicitly by using the alias "default".
           Example:

               $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance \
                   --scopes compute-rw me@project.gserviceaccount.com=storage-rw

           If this flag is not provided, the "storage-ro" scope is added to
           the instances. To create instances with no scopes, use
           "--no-scopes":

               $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance --no-scopes

           SCOPE can be either the full URI of the scope or an alias.
           Available aliases are:

           Alias            URI
           bigquery         https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery
           compute-ro       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute.readonly
           compute-rw       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute

           datastore        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/datastore
           sql              https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice
           sql-admin        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/sqlservice.admin
           storage-full     https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control
           storage-ro       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only
           storage-rw       https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_write
           taskqueue        https://www.googleapis.com/auth/taskqueue
           userinfo-email   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email


       --tags TAG [TAG ...]
           Specifies a list of tags to apply to the instances for identifying
           the instances to which network firewall rules will apply. See
           gcloud-compute-firewalls-create(1) for more details.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the instances to create. If not specified, you will be
           prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To create an instance with the latest "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6"
       image available, run:

           $ gcloud compute instances create my-instance \
               --image rhel-6 --zone us-central1-a

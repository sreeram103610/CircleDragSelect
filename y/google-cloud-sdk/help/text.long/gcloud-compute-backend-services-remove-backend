DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute backend-services remove-backend is used to remove a
       backend from a backend service.

       Before removing a backend, it is a good idea to "drain" the backend
       first. A backend can be drained by setting its capacity scaler to zero
       through gcloud compute backend-services edit.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the backend service.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --group GROUP
           The name of a Google Cloud Resource View used by the backend to be
           removed.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the resource view to remove from the backend service.
           If not specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute target-http-proxies update is used to change the URL map
       of existing target HTTP proxies. A target HTTP proxy is referenced by
       one or more forwarding rules which define which packets the proxy is
       responsible for routing. The target HTTP proxy in turn points to a URL
       map that defines the rules for routing the requests. The URL map's job
       is to map URLs to backend services which handle the actual requests.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the target HTTP proxy.

FLAGS
       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --url-map URL_MAP
           A reference to a URL map resource that will define the mapping of
           URLs to backend services. The URL map must exist and cannot be
           deleted while referenced by a target HTTP proxy.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

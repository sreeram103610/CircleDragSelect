DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute backend-services create is used to create backend
       services. Backend services define groups of backends that can receive
       traffic. Each backend group has parameters that define the group's
       capacity (e.g., max CPU utilization, max queries per second, ...). URL
       maps define which requests are sent to which backend services.

       Backend services created through this command will start out without
       any backend groups. To add backend groups, use gcloud compute
       backend-services add-backend or gcloud compute backend-services edit.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the backend service.

FLAGS
       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the backend service.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --http-health-check HTTP_HEALTH_CHECK
           An HTTP health check object for checking the health of the backend
           service.

       --port PORT
           The TCP port to use when connecting to the backend.

       --port-name PORT_NAME
           A user-defined port name used to resolve which port to use on each
           backend. "--port" will be deprecated soon and only port_name will
           be used. Port name will be matched to the (port_name, ports)
           specified in the resource view backend groups that are added to
           this backend service. The port name should be RFC1035-labels
           compliant (e.g., "http", "www1-static").

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --timeout TIMEOUT
           The amount of time to wait for a backend to respond to a request
           before considering the request failed. For example, specifying
           "10s" will give backends 10 seconds to respond to requests. Valid
           units for this flag are "s" for seconds, "m" for minutes, and "h"
           for hours.

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

NAME
       gcloud-compute-addresses-create - Reserve IP addresses

SYNOPSIS
       gcloud compute addresses create
         [NAME ...]
         [--addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]]
         [--description DESCRIPTION]
         [--format FORMAT]
         [--help]
         [--project PROJECT]
         [--quiet, -q]
         [--global | --region REGION]
         [-h]

DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute addresses create is used to reserve one or more IP
       addresses. Once an IP address is reserved, it will be associated with
       the project until it is released using gcloud compute addresses delete.
       Ephemeral IP addresses that are in use by resources in the project, can
       be reserved using the "--addresses" flag.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       [NAME ...]
           The names to assign to the reserved IP addresses.

FLAGS
       --addresses ADDRESS [ADDRESS ...]
           Ephemeral IP addresses to promote to reserved status. Only
           addresses that are being used by resources in the project can be
           promoted. When providing this flag, a parallel list of names for
           the addresses can be provided. For example,

               $ gcloud compute addresses create my-address-1 my-address-2 \
                   --addresses 162.222.181.197 162.222.181.198 \
                   --region us-central1

       will result in 162.222.181.197 being reserved as "my-address-1" and
       162.222.181.198 as "my-address-2". If no names are given,
       randomly-generated names will be assigned to the IP addresses.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional textual description for the addresses.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --global
           If provided, it is assumed the addresses are global.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --region REGION
           The region of the address to operate on. If not specified, you will
           be prompted to select a region.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/region" property:

               gcloud config set compute/region REGION

           A list of regions can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute regions list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/region

           Alternatively, the region can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_REGION".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.

EXAMPLES
       To reserve three IP addresses in the "us-central1" region, run:

           $ gcloud compute addresses create my-address-1 my-address-2 my-address-3 \
               --region us-central1

       To reserve ephemeral IP addresses 162.222.181.198 and 23.251.146.189
       which are being used by virtual machine instances in the "us-central1"
       region, run:

           $ gcloud compute addresses create --addresses 162.222.181.198 23.251.146.189 \
               --region us-central1

       In the above invocation, the two addresses will be assigned random
       names.
